That’s a great idea — patterns with circles and gradients offer lots of creative potential. To make your tool both powerful and enjoyable for users, you can add a variety of features spanning design customization, user experience, and export options. Here's a categorized breakdown of feature ideas:

---

## 🎨 **Core Features**

### 1. **Pattern Types**

* **Linear grid**: Regular rows and columns of circles.
* **Radial pattern**: Circles radiating from a center point.
* **Spiral pattern**
* **Random scatter**: For a more organic look.

### 2. **Gradient Options**

* **Gradient types**: Linear, radial, conic.
* **Multi-stop gradients**: Let users add more than two colors.
* **Custom gradient angles** (for linear).
* **Gradient per shape** or **global background gradient**.

### 3. **Color Tools**

* **Color palettes**: Predefined themes + custom.
* **Color harmonies**: Complementary, analogous, etc.
* **Opacity/transparency control**
* **Noise overlay**: For textured looks.

## ⚙️ **Circle Customization**

* **Size variation** (random, fixed, based on position)
* **Spacing control** (margin/padding between circles)
* **Stroke vs. fill**
* **Stroke width & color**
* **Shape toggle**: Circle, ellipse, or custom SVG shape
* **Blend modes** (e.g., multiply, screen)

## 📐 **Layout & Positioning**

* **Canvas size** (preset + custom)
* **Grid alignment**: Tight, loose, offset (like hex grid)
* **Rotation**: Rotate entire pattern
* **Symmetry tools**: Reflect, mirror, kaleidoscope

## 🛠️ **Interactivity & UX**

* **Live preview**
* **Undo/redo**
* **Zoom in/out**
* **Drag to pan canvas**
* **Snap to grid toggle**
* **Save/load pattern settings (presets)**

## 💾 **Export Options**

* **Export as PNG, JPG, SVG**
* **Export gradient as CSS**
* **Copy SVG code**
* **Pattern as tile (seamless pattern generation)**

---

## 🔁 **Generative/Random Options**

* **Randomize button**: Create new designs at random.
* **Random seed**: So users can reproduce a design.
* **Controlled randomness**: Slider to set randomness intensity.

## 🧩 **Advanced/Bonus Features**

* **Animation support**

  * Pulsing, rotating gradients
  * Export as GIF or MP4
* **Layering**

  * Stack multiple pattern layers with blend modes.
* **Pattern mask/clip**

  * Clip the pattern to a shape (e.g., text or icon).
* **Interactive gradient editor**

  * Drag stops, preview updates live.
* **AI pattern suggestions**

  * Suggest gradient/color setups based on mood keywords ("sunset", "ocean", "neon", etc.)

If you’d like, I can help sketch out a UI wireframe or write a basic prototype in HTML/JS/CSS for some of these features. Just let me know your tech stack or where you want to start.
